This RAR file contains two M files and two SLX files, which are based on MATLAB 2018b. These files include the code and simulation models used in the paper TSG-0134-2024. 
Run the M file named "Infinite_Union_Method_case1" (take lambda=1.2 and lambda=1.4), and the original graphs of Fig.5 are obtained. 
Run the SLX file named "Infinite_Union_Method_case1", and the original graphs of Fig.6 are obtained. 
Run the M file named "Infinite_Union_Method_case2" (take lambda=1.3, 1.5, 1.9 and 2.0), and the original graphs of Fig.7 are obtained. 
Run the SLX file named "Infinite_Union_Method_case2", and the original graphs of Fig.8 are obtained.
